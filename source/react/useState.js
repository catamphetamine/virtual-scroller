		// State updates are incremental meaning that this code should mimick
		// the classic `React.Component`'s `this.setState()` behavior
		// when calling `this.setState()` doesn't replace `state` but rather merges
		// a set of the updated state properties with the rest of the old ones.
		//
		// The reason is that `useState()` updates are "asynchronous" (not immediate),
		// and simply merging over `...state` would merge over potentially stale
		// property values in cases when more than a single `updateState()` call is made
		// before the state actually updates, resulting in losing some of the state updates.
		//
		// For example, the first `updateState()` call updates shown item indexes,
		// and the second `updateState()` call updates `verticalSpacing`.
		// If it was simply `updateState({ ...state, ...stateUpdate })`
		// then the second state update could overwrite the first state update,
		// resulting in incorrect items being shown/hidden.
		//
		// Using `...state.current` instead of `...pendingState.current` here
		// would produce "stale" results.

			// But, since all of that happens at render time and not in an "effect",
			// if the state update was done as usual by calling `_setStateUpdate()`,
			// React would throw an error about updating state during render.
			// Hence, state update in that particular case should happen "directly",
			// without waiting for an "asynchronous" effect to trigger and call
			// an "asyncronous" `_setStateUpdate()` function.
			//
			// Updating state directly in that particular case works because there
			// already is a render ongoing, so there's no need to re-render the component
			// again after such render-time state update.
			//
			// When the initial `VirtualScroller` state is being set, it contains an `.items`
			// property too, but that initial setting is done using another function called
			// `setInitialState()`, so using `if (stateUpdate.items)` condition here for describing
			// just the case when `state` has been updated as a result of a `setItems()` call
			// seems to be fine.
