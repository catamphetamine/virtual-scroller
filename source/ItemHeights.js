				// will be 10 individual `.onItemHeightChange(i)` calls. No issues so far.
				// But, as the first `.onItemHeightChange(i)` call executes, it immediately
				// ("synchronously") triggers a re-layout, and immediately after that re-layout
				// `itemHeights.measureNonPreviouslyMeasuredItemHeights()` function is called,
				// that detects the height mismatch for all the rest of the items.
				// So, even though the developer has written their code properly, there're

				// and the `.onItemHeightChange(i)` call hasn't been executed for this item yet.
